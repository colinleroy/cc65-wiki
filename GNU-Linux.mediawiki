You have two options: You can compile everything from scratch. In this case, just proceed as described in [http://cc65.github.io/cc65/getting-started.html Getting Started].

Another option is to use pre-built binaries, which are available in different flavours:

* A variant for Debian based systems (.DEB) [[OBS: Debian .DEB and RPM]]
* A variant for [[Fedora Linux]]
* A variant for [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Oracle Linux]]
