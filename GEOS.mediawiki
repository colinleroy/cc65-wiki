== File Deconversion ==
Using cc65 together with an emulator gives in general excellent turnaround times. But when it comes to GEOS development the manual deconversion of the CONVERT file generated by cc65 into a GEOS file quickly becomes very cumbersome. Therefore it is desirable to replace the explicit deconversion done using CONVERT 2.5 (for GEOS 64/128) or CONVERT.SYSTEM (for Apple GEOS) with an implicit deconversion done by the tool used to write the CONVERT file to the disk image.

=== GEOS 64/128 ===
The [http://www.viceteam.org/vice_10.html VICE c1541 tool] has a ''geoswrite'' command that is supposed to do the trick, but at least for me the one from WinVICE-2.2-x86.zip just crashes when I try that command. In contrast [http://sta.c64.org/sc.html The Star Commander] works fine for me but is a little complicated to use as command line tool. In order to write i.e. the file '''test.cvt''' to the disk image '''geos.d64''' you need a text file '''sc.txt''' containing:
<pre>
set ConfConvFileName False
set AutoOver All
copy test.cvt Disk:geos.d64\test
</pre>
Then you can use this command:
<pre>
sc.exe /cmd @sc.txt
</pre>

=== Apple GEOS ===
By the time of this writing (10/2012) CONVERT file deconversion hasn't made it into the ''Stable Release'' of [http://applecommander.sourceforge.net/ AppleCommander]. However the latest ''Interim Release Candidate'' contains it. In order to write i.e. the file '''test.cvt''' to the disk image '''geos.dsk''' you can use this command:
<pre>
java -jar ac.jar -geos geos.dsk < test.cvt
</pre>

== Internals ==
GEOS requires a 6502 compatible CPU (e.g. 6510 or 8510). For binary compatibility you will need RAM at $c100-$c2ff.

=== GEOS 64/128, GEOS Plus/4 ===
* APP_RAM $04xx-$5xxx
* PRINTBASE $60xx
* OS_VARS $8xxx
* DISK_BASE $9xxx
* SCREEN_BASE $axxx-$bxxx
* OS_JUMPTAB $c1xx-$c2xx
* disk block size $100

=== Apple GEOS ===
* APP_RAM $4xxx-
* PRINTBASE $79xx
* OS_JUMPTAB $fexx-$ffxx, $03xx
* disk block size $200
