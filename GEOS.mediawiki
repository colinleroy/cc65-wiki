== File Deconversion ==
Using cc65 together with an emulator gives, in general, excellent turnaround times. But, when it comes to GEOS development, the manual deconversion of the CONVERT file generated by cc65 into a GEOS file quickly becomes very cumbersome. Therefore, it is desirable to replace the explicit deconversion done using CONVERT 2.5 (for GEOS 64/128) or CONVERT.SYSTEM (for Apple GEOS) with an implicit deconversion done by the tool used to write the CONVERT file to the disk image.

=== GEOS 64/128 ===
The [http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_12.html VICE c1541 tool] has a ''geoswrite'' command that is supposed to do the trick; but, at least for me, the one from WinVICE-2.2-x86.zip just crashes when I try that command. In contrast, [http://sta.c64.org/sc.html The Star Commander] works fine for me, but is a little complicated to use as a command-line tool. In order to write, e.g., the file '''test.cvt''' to the disk image '''geos.d64''', you need a text file '''sc.txt''' containing:
<pre>
set ConfConvFileName False
set AutoOver All
copy test.cvt Disk:geos.d64\test
</pre>
Then, you can use this command:
<pre>
sc.exe /cmd @sc.txt
</pre>

=== Apple GEOS ===
[https://applecommander.github.io/ AppleCommander] supports CONVERT file deconversion. In order to write, e.g., the file '''test.cvt''' to the disk image '''geos.dsk''', you can use this command:
<pre>
java -jar ac.jar -geos geos.dsk < test.cvt
</pre>

== Internals ==
GEOS requires a 6502-compatible CPU (e.g., 6510 or 8510). For binary compatibility, you will need RAM at $c100-$c2ff.
