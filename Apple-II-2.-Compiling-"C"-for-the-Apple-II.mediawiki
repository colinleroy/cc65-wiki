Save the following code as hello.c
<pre>
#include <conio.h>  

void main(void)  
{  
  cputs("Hello, World!\n");  
  cgetc();  
}
</pre>
Compile the program to hello.apple2 (the -o isnâ€™t needed but adding it with .apple2 will make sense later, in the make section). Used the command line: <code>cl65 -t apple2 hello.c -o hello.apple2</code>

Now you have an Apple II ready program, but it needs to go on a disk so it can be loaded in an emulator.
