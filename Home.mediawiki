This Wiki contains all info that does not fit into the regular [http://cc65.github.io/doc documentation] and/or the [https://cc65.github.io website].

Codestyle rules and other important stuff for those who want to contribute to the cc65 project can be found in [https://github.com/cc65/cc65/blob/master/Contributing.md Contributing.md]

== Pages that should be moved ==

The following pages contain info that should most likely be moved into the regular documentation, instead of hiding them here on the wiki.(Obviously this is not a hard rule and each individual case needs to be carefully reviewed and edited/modified if needed.)

It should be done for the following reasons:

* The cc65 package should be self contained and all documentation for the end user should be included (he shouldn't have to look up extra stuff on the wiki)
* The wiki is unfortunately much more "closed" than the linuxdoc documentation (The wiki can only be edited by team members, the documentation can be updated by anyone via pull requests).

=== To Contributing.md ===

* [[Roadmap]] (needs a critical review, and the relevant parts moved into "Roadmap" and/or "TODO" sections)
* [[Reminders]] (needs a critical review, and the relevant parts moved into "Roadmap" and/or "TODO" sections)

=== To the user manual (LinuxDoc) ===

* [[Atari-2600]]
* [[Apple-II-1.-Emulators-and-related-software]]
* [[Changes]] (if there is actually still relevant info on this page move it into the docs)
* [[Commodore-Machines]]
* [[The-.ORG-directive]]
* [[Direct-console-IO]]
* [[GEOS]]
* [[Interrupt-handlers-in-C]]
* [[PEEK-and-POKE]]
* [[Tiny Graphics Interface]]

==== for Developers ====

We may add an addition section in the documentation, which is targetted at those who want to develop either external programs that work with cc65, or those that want to develop/extend the libraries.

* Debug info related (perhaps make a new page cc65-debuginfo.html for this)
** [[debug-info-overview|Overview]]
** [[debug-info-data|Available information]]
** [[debug-info-module|Module usage and API calls]]

* Library internals (most can probably go to cc65-intern.html)
** [[Parameter-and-return-stacks]]
** [[Parameter-passing-and-calling-conventions]]
** [[Priority-of-constructors,-destructors,-and-interruptors]]
** [[Segment-usage-of-constructors]]
** [[The-primary-register]]
** [[Using-runtime-zeropage-locations-in-assembly-language]]
