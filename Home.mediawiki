== What is cc65? ==

cc65 is a complete package, which includes

* a C compiler for machines with a 6502 compatible CPU,
* a powerful macro assembler,
* linker, librarian and several other tools,
* target libraries that support common 6502 platform like the Commodore C64, the Atari 8-bit machines, the Apple II and others,
* [http://oliverschmidt.github.com/cc65/doc/ documentation] and more.

== Downloading and installing ==

According to the original author and former maintainer: "with one exception in the compiler (access()) the code is plain ISO C, so it should compile on most systems. Memory usage may be a problem, however."

cc65 can surely be compiled and run on the following platforms, for which GNU Compiler Collection - [http://gcc.gnu.org GCC] is available.

* [[GNU/Linux]]
* [[OS X]]
* [[Microsoft Windows]]
* [[AmigaOS]]

== Target platforms ==

* [[Atari 2600]]
* [[Commodore machines]]
* [[GEOS]]
