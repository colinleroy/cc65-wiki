== What is cc65? ==

cc65 is a complete package, which includes

* a C compiler for machines with a 6502-compatible CPU,
* a powerful macro assembler,
* linker, librarian, and several other tools,
* target libraries that support common 6502 platforms like the Commodore C64, the Atari 8-bit machines, the Apple II, and others,
* [http://cc65.github.io/cc65/doc/ documentation] and more.

== Host platforms ==

According to the original author and former maintainer: "With one exception in the compiler [access()], the code is plain ISO C; so, it should compile on most systems. Memory usage may be a problem, however."

cc65 can surely be compiled and run on the following platforms, for which GNU Compiler Collection -- [http://gcc.gnu.org GCC] -- is available.

* [[AmigaOS]]
* [[GNU/Linux]]
* [[Microsoft Windows]]
* [[OS X]]
* GNU/QNX

== Target platforms ==

* [[Apple II]]
* [[Atari 2600]] and other Atari 8-bit machines
* [[Commodore machines]]
* [[GEOS]]
* Nintendo Entertainment System game console
* Watara Supervision game console
