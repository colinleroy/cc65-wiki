It is often very handy to be able to use a simple text display to convey information when using a graphics program. The Apple II has the ability to ''shorten'' the graphics display, and use the last (bottom) 4 rows of text, as text. These rows can then be accessed and used as a normal text display.

<blockquote>By ''shorten'' I mean the following:<br />
* Lowres, normally 48 rows, will become 40 rows tall.<br />
* Hires and Color, normally 192 rows tall, will become 160 rows tall.
</blockquote>
Using this mode is very simple. Simply touch <code>MIXSET</code> ($C053) to enable the last 4 lines as text, and touch <code>MIXCLR</code> ($C052) to disable the 4 lines for full-screen graphics.
