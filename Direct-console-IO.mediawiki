'''"I've found a bug: cprintf() doesn't seem to handle a newline correctly. It places the cursor in the next line; but, doesn't move it to the beginning of the line."'''

'''"When outputting a newline in the last screen line using one of the conio functions, the screen doesn't scroll. Instead, the program behaves erratically, and does sometimes crash."'''

The conio library is different from output done via printf(). It was designed primarily for programs using dialogue-oriented full-screen masks. As a consequence, ...

* ... CR (\r) and LF (\n) have a different meaning. The first one moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line; the second one moves it straight down into the next line.
* ... conio doesn't scroll the screen when moving below the last line. In fact, allowing that to happen might spell disaster on several machines because, for performance reasons, there are no checks.
