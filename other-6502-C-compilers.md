# cross compilers

* (OSS) [https://gitlab.com/camelot/kickc](KickC) is a C-compiler for 6502-based platforms creating optimized and readable assembler code. The language is 95% standard C with a few limitations and a few extensions.
* (OSS) [https://github.com/llvm-mos](llvm-mos)
* (OSS) [http://sdcc.sourceforge.net](SDCC) is a retargettable, optimizing Standard C (ANSI C89, ISO C99, ISO C11) compiler suite that targets the Intel MCS51 based microprocessors (8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.), Maxim (formerly Dallas) DS80C390 variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08 based (hc08, s08), Zilog Z80 based MCUs (Z80, Z180, SM83, Rabbit 2000, 2000A, 3000A, TLCS-90), Padauk (pdk14, pdk15) and STMicroelectronics STM8. Work is in progress on supporting the Padauk pdk13 and MOS 6502 targets; Microchip PIC16 and PIC18 targets are unmaintained. SDCC can be retargeted for other microprocessors.
* (semi-open)[http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html](VBCC) is a highly optimizing portable and retargetable ISO C compiler. It supports ISO C according to ISO/IEC 9899:1989 and most of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99).
* (OSS) [https://github.com/itszor/gcc-6502](GCC-6502) (inactive for over 5 years)
* (OSS) [http://www.kdef.com/geek/vic/quetz.html](Quetzalcoatl) can compile and link programs written in a subset of ANSI C called Tiny C, Assembler, the 1983 UPL language or any combination thereof. (inactive for decades)
* (commercial, free) [https://wdc65xx.com/downloads/](WDCTools Suite) (windows only)
