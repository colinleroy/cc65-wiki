The cc65 source tree contains the file [https://raw.github.com/cc65/cc65/master/libsrc/geos-common/symbols.txt libsrc/geos-common/symbols.txt]. This file lists the actual addresses of all public '''GEOS variables''' and '''GEOS routines''' for GEOS 64, GEOS 128 and Apple GEOS. That information was extracted from [http://lyonlabs.org/commodore/onrequest/geos-manuals/The_Hitchhikers_Guide_to_GEOS.pdf The Hitchhiker's Guide To GEOS] and carefully proofread to correct OCR errors.
