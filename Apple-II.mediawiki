== Apple GEOS ==

The only publicly available information source on Apple GEOS internals is [http://lyonlabs.org/commodore/onrequest/geos-manuals/The_Hitchhikers_Guide_to_GEOS.pdf The Hitchhiker's Guide To GEOS]. That information is for sure necessary but unfortunately not sufficient to actually create Apple GEOS applications. Therefore additional material is collected here.
