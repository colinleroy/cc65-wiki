== Overview ==

The Apple II family is supported by cc65 through the two targets

* '''apple2''' for Apple <nowiki>][+</nowiki> (or later) machines
* '''apple2enh''' for enhanced Apple //e (or later) machines
** CPU (6502 vs. 65C02)
** Text screen (only the latter can have 80 columns)
** Lowercase chars (only the latter can display inverse lc)
** Keyboard (only the latter has up/down keys)

== Getting Started ==
There's a tutorial style introduction to working with the Apple II [https://github.com/cc65/wiki/wiki/Apple-II-Getting-Started here].

== Tools ==

* [[LOADER.SYSTEM]]

== Sample Code ==

== Apple GEOS ==

The only publicly available information source on Apple GEOS internals is [https://archive.org/details/The_Hitchhikers_Guide_to_GEOS The Hitchhiker's Guide To GEOS]. That information is for sure necessary but unfortunately not sufficient to actually create Apple GEOS applications. Therefore additional material is collected here.

* [[Apple GEOS zeropage usage]]
