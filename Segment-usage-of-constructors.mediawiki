Depending on the linker config file the RAM used by constructors may be reused by the segment BSS and/or the heap and/or the software stack. Therefore constructors must follow these rules:

* Code of constructors (and code only called by constructors) is ''not'' placed in the segment CODE, but in the segment ONCE.
* Data read only by constructors is ''not'' placed in the segment RODATA, but in the segment ONCE.
* Data created by constructors is ''not'' placed in the segment BSS, but in the segment INIT.
* Data written by constructors is placed in the segment DATA.

As the segment INIT is not zeroed before constructors are called the constructors mustn't presume any values in the segment INIT. If the constructor logic doesn't implicitly always set a value in the segment INIT but rather requires explicit zeroing then it may be preferable to instead place the value in the segment DATA. Both alternatives have the same RAM size requirement while running main() but they differ in disk size requirement. The sequence <tt>LDA #0 STA &lt;abs&gt;</tt> to zero a value in the segment INIT is i.e. 4 bytes larger than a <tt>.byte 0</tt> in the segment DATA.
