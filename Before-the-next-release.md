On this page we collect things to be done before the next release. After a release, the page will be whiped and we start from scratch.

* move all Wiki pages that fit into Contributing.md or the Documentation
* make Contributing.md more complete
* make the github action(s) build the documentation and upload it to the webpage
* make a github action that produces a release
* come up with a good way to handle external contributions to the wiki
* make the compiler define some macro depending on selected standard
    * fix library headers to comply with the c-standards
* fix the broken version macro(s)
* make sure the website, wiki and .md files are all prominently cross linked
