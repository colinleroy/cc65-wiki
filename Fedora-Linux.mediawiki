These instructions provide a step-by-step guide for installing cc65 on [https://getfedora.org Fedora] Linux.

== Step 1: Install cc65 ==

The following command installs the cc65 executable programs, it may also install the documentation and additional utilities as weak dependencies.

<pre>
sudo dnf install cc65
</pre>

== Step 2: Optional packages ==

There are additional pre-built packages, that can be installed without dependencies on the cc65 compiler:

The following command installs the documentation (html and GNU/info) for the cc65 compiler.

<pre>
sudo dnf install cc65-doc
</pre>

To install the additional utilities, which are shipped in the [https://github.com/cc65/cc65/tree/master/util util directory of the git repository], simply use this command.

<pre>
sudo dnf install cc65-utils
</pre>

Those utilities programs are:

* /usr/bin/ataricvt65
** Conversion between Atari and ISO-8859-1 character set.
* /usr/bin/ca65html
** Convert a ca65 source into HTML
* /usr/bin/cbmcvt65
** Conversion between PetSCII and ISO-8859-1 character set.
* /usr/bin/deflater65
** Compresses data to the DEFLATE format. The compressed data is ready to use with the inflatemem() routine from cc65's zlib.
* /usr/bin/gamate-fixcart65
** Adds a checksum to a Gamate Cartridge ROM image.

== Step 3: Bookmark the Documentation ==

To be successful working with software development tools you need quick access to the documentation. I keep a very organized set of bookmarks in my browser so that I can quickly get answers to questions that come up during development. One can waste a lot of time looking for information if it is not readily available. So I suggest creating a bookmark in your browser for the following local file which is the starting point for the cc65 documentation in HTML format.

In Firefox you can press Ctrl-O to open a file. Enter the below path. Then bookmark it with Ctrl-D.

<pre>
/usr/share/doc/cc65/html/index.html
</pre>
